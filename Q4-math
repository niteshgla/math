##Write a Python program to calculate surface volume and area of a cylinder.
Note: A cylinder is one of the most basic curvilinear geometric shapes, the surface formed by the points at a fixed distance from a given straight line, the axis of the cylinder.


pi=22/7
height = float(input('Height of cylinder: '))
radian = float(input('Radius of cylinder: '))
volume = pi * radian * radian * height
sur_area = ((2*pi*radian) * height) + ((pi*radian**2)*2)
print("Volume is: ", volume)
print("Surface Area is: ", sur_area)
