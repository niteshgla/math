##Write a Python program to convert radian to degree.
Note: The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. An angle's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle; one radian is just under 57.3 degrees (when the arc length is equal to the radius).


pi=22/7
radian = float(input("Input radians: "))
degree = radian*(180/pi)
print(degree)
