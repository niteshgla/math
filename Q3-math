##Write a Python program to calculate the area of a parallelogram.
Note: A parallelogram is a quadrilateral with opposite sides parallel (and therefore opposite angles equal). A quadrilateral with equal sides is called a rhombus, and a parallelogram whose angles are all right angles is called a rectangle.


base = float(input('Length of base: '))
height = float(input('Measurement of height: '))
area = base * height
print("Area is: ", area)
